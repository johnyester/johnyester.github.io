Embedded software developer in automotive ADAS/AD product development related to:
- data collection, visualization, and manipulation
- control systems reseach and development. 

### More Information

My motivation for this blog is to share ideas I'm working on to apply low cost sensors and hardware for sports tracking.
- Leveraging low cost hardware (a la Raspberry Po) as a platform for:
  - embeddable sensors
  - intelligent agents
  - distributed computation
  
Additionaly, since most of the tools I use support Markdown, I hope this blog will assist me with developing addtional capability in my code documentation process.

Professionaly, I'm involved in software development for:
  - Vehicle data collection and data reduction for automated map generation 
  - Neural Networks for behavioral modeling
  - Dynamic systems modeling and simulation


Other (future) areas I hope discuss include:
- Data scrubing and visualization
- Camera image processing and other sensor data applications
- Dynamic systems modeling and validation
- Automated spreadsheet generation
- Automated PDF generation for results sharing and reporting.
